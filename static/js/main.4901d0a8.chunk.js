The cuticle of the cell is a protein produced by the epidermis, and is a tough but flexible layer. This helps minimize water loss. Then, there is the epidermis. It translates to "outer skin", and it basically is the layer of plant cell closest to the outside (other than the guard cells). Then, we have the mesophyll. There are two parts: the palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll. Each of them have different functions. The palisade does most of the photosynthesis. It is vertically elongated and stacked up against the epidermis in order to absorb as much light as possible. Thus, these cells do most of the photosynthesis. Next is the spongy mesophyll. These have less chloroplasts, and do more cellular respiration. However, its main job is to regulate the gass exchange in the cell. Finally, we have the guard cell. These cells are along the bottom of the leaf and allow the opening and closing of the stoma (plural stomata), which are pores that let in gasses into the leaf. High water pressure in the guard cells means that water wants to move out, so the stoma opens. Low water pressure means there is less water, so the stoma will close.',n.a.createElement("h2",null,"Vascular Transport"),n.a.createElement("img",{alt:"",src:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Translocation_from_the_source_to_the_sink_within_the_phloem.svg/2880px-Translocation_from_the_source_to_the_sink_within_the_phloem.svg.png"}),n.a.createElement("br",null),"There are two main structures in vascular transport: the xylem and phloem.
